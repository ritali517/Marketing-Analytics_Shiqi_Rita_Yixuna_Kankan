## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1.a.  What's the data problem
First of all, descriptions of each variable is missing, which may cause some misunderstanding for users. Second of all, some variables are redundant, for instance, the dataset has both codes and names for the race/gender/ethnicity variables, which is unnecessary and requires huge amount of cleaning. Third, there are many missing data in some key variables, such as for applicant's income data, out of roughly 60000 of 439654 data are missing. Forth, the data contains some outliers in terms of annual income and loan amount. Finally, we believe the dataset should specify the sampling method.

1.b. Managerial objective
The managerial objective is to specify the key determinants of obtaining a mortgage from financial institutions. The determinants may include applicant characteristics, property types, loan purpose and location. Therefore, we should figure out the relationships between loan action taken and relevant variables through regression or other statistical methods. 

2. Measurement type of each variable
Character: action_taken_name, agency_name, agency_abbr, applicant_ethnicity_name, applicant_race_name_1, applicant_sex_name, county_name, hoepa_status_name, lien_status_name, loan_purpose_name, loan_type_name, msamd_name, owner_occupancy_name, preapproval_name, property_type_name, purchaser_type_name


Nominal: action_taken, agency_code, applicant_ethnicity, applicant_race_1, applicant_sex, county_code, hoepa_status, lien_status, loan_purpose, loan_type, msamd, owner_occupancy, preapproval, property_type, purchaser_type, respondent_id, sequence_number 

Ratio: applicant_income_000s, hud_median_family_income, laon_amount_000s, number_of_1_to_4_family_units, number_of_owner_occupied_units, minority_population, population, tract_to_msamd_income

4. Missing data
1) Identify key variables
Actions in loans, race, ethnicity, gender, income, loan purpose, loan type, lien status, loan amount, property type
2) Change inputs that are not applicable to null

```{r Clean data1}
NYHMDA$Hispanic="0"
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$applicant_ethnicity==3,]$Hispanic=NA
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$applicant_ethnicity==4,]$Hispanic=NA
NYHMDA$Male="0"
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$applicant_sex==3,]$Male=NA
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$applicant_sex==4,]$Male=NA
NYHMDA$Race="0"
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$applicant_race_1==6,]$Race=NA
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$applicant_race_1==7,]$Race=NA
NYHMDA$First_lien="0"
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$lien_status==4,]$First_lien=NA
NYHMDA$Principal_dwelling="0"
NYHMDA[NYHMDA$owner_occupancy==3,]$Principal_dwelling=NA
```
3) Delete columns with unnecessary variables
```{r clean data2}
NYHMDA_clear<-subset(NYHMDA,select=-c(10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,68,69,70,77))
```
4) Delete rows with missing data
```{r clean data3}
NYHMDA_new<-na.omit(NYHMDA_clear)
summary(NYHMDA_new)
```

3. Table summarizing range/variation of each variable
```{r summarizing table}
###Action taken
table(NYHMDA_new$action_taken_name)
###Agency name
table(NYHMDA_new$agency_abbr)
###Applicant ethnicity name
table(NYHMDA_new$applicant_ethnicity_name)

5. Analysis for key variables(histogram/density plot)
Variables deem necessary:
Actions in loans, ethnicity, race, income, loan purpose, gender, lien status, loan amount
5.a Actions in loans
```{r histogram}
hist(NYHMDA_new$action_taken,col="blue",main="Loan action taken",ylab="Count",xlab="Actions taken")
legend('topright',c("1: Loan originated","2: Application approved but not accepted","3: Denied","4: Withdrawed"
                    ,"5: File closed for incompleteness","6: Loan purchased by institution","7: Preapproval denied"),cex=0.7)
```
Among all the samples, most of loans are originated. 

5.b Ethnicity
```{r ethnicity}
hist(NYHMDA_new$applicant_ethnicity,col="blue",main="Applicant ethnicity",ylab="Count",xlab="Ethnicity",xaxt="n")

```
Among all loan applicants, most of them are non hispanic or latino applicants. 
5.c Race
```{r race}
hist(NYHMDA_new$applicant_race_1,col="blue",main="Applicant race",ylab="Count",xlab="Race")
legend('top',c("1: American Indian or Alaska Native","2: Asian","3: Black or African American","4: Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"
                    ,"5: White"),cex=0.7)
```
Among all loan applicants, most of them are white people. 

5.d Income
```{r income}
plot(density(NYHMDA_new$applicant_income_000s),xlab="Income",ylab="Density",main="Applicant income level",xlim=c(1,300),col="darkgreen")

5.f Gender
```{r gender}
plot(NYHMDA_new$applicant_sex_name,col="blue",main="Applicant gender",ylab="Count")
```
The number of male applicants is almost twice the number of female applicants.

  facet_wrap(~NYHMDA_new$action_taken_name)+
  labs(x="Income level",y="Loan amount",title="Loan actions taken,loan amount and income level")
```

7. Data pattern indication
In terms of loan actions taken, we expects applicants with higher annual income have higher chance of obtaining a mortgage and the pattern do shows that applicants who have obtained a loan have higher annual income than those applicants whose loans were denied. 
As for loan purpose, the probability of getting a loan is higher when the purpose of loan is home purchase rather than home improvement and refinancing.
In terms of applicant gender and ethnicity, male applicants and non-Hispanic or Latino are more likely to get the loan in the sample. However, this conclusion is not very persuasive since there are much more male and non-Hispanic or Latino in the sample dataset. Lack of female applicants can be the fact that women are less likely to secure a loan or they have relatively lower income thus less likely to secure a loan. 
For applicants whose loans are originated, none of them are not secured by a lien. However, for applicants whose loans are denied, some of them are not secured by a lien.
With regard to the relationship between loan amount and applicant income level, applicants who have higher income tend to apply for greater amount of loan, and these applications are more likely to be approved.

In conclusion, the more income and senior lien an applicant has, the more likely she/he will get the loan from financial institutions.
